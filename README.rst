Trigger Utilities for Parallel SPM Lithography
===============================================
* Each cantilever in the array is assigned a separate / unique pattern to draw.
* Since the cantilevers do not have the ability to move independently, we need to be able to "turn-on" and "off" the
  writing for each cantilever in real-time automatically according to it's assigned pattern
* This utility enables said capability.
